## Pre-release (platform compile)

CI runs debug smoke builds plus **release compile** for Android (`apk` + `appbundle`) and Windows (`--release`) — see `.github/workflows/`. Locally, before tagging:

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release   # with android/key.properties for real signing
flutter build apk --release
flutter build windows --release
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign   # compile-only smoke
flutter build macos --release
flutter build ipa --release --export-options-plist=ios/ExportOptions.plist
```

See [packaging.md](packaging.md) for signing, FFmpeg, Inno Setup installer, and Apple release steps.

## Guidelines

- Prefer **fast, deterministic** unit tests (no real `Player` in CI unless using integration harness).
- For playback integration, plan dedicated integration tests / golden tests later.
- After changing `@DriftDatabase` or `@Riverpod` annotations, run `dart run build_runner build` before tests.
