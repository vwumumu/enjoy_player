## How to add an ADR

1. Copy the template in [decisions/README.md](decisions/README.md).  
2. Use the next number: `000N-short-title.md`.  
3. **Do not rewrite old ADRs** — supersede with a new one.

## How to update a feature spec

Edit the matching file under [features/](features/) in the **same PR** as the code change.
