# Feature: Dictionary lookup (transcript)

## Summary

While playback is open, the user can **select 1–100 characters** on the **active** transcript cue or on any cue inside the **echo window**. A **bottom sheet** opens automatically (debounced) with:

1. **Translation** — `POST /translations` via `translationServiceProvider`.
2. **Definition (dictionary)** — `POST /dictionary/query` via `dictionaryServiceProvider` (word = selected text only). In the sheet UI this section is labeled **Definition** / **释义** (`lookupSectionDictionary`).
3. **Contextual translation** — LLM markdown via `POST /chat/completions` through `contextualTranslationServiceProvider` (system prompts aligned with web `contextual-translation`); includes optional **surrounding transcript context** from `buildVocabularyContext`.

Sections appear in the sheet in that order: translation, then definition/dictionary, then contextual translation.

## Languages

- **Lookup catalog** — `kSupportedLookupLanguageTags` ([`lib/core/application/app_language_catalog.dart`](../../lib/core/application/app_language_catalog.dart)) is the **separate** source of truth for the lookup sheet's source / target options. First-wave 14 tags: `en-US`, `en-GB`, `zh-CN`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`, `es-ES`, `es-MX`, `fr-FR`, `fr-CA`, `de-DE`, `it-IT`, `pt-BR`, `pt-PT`, `ru-RU`. Decoupled from `kSupportedNativeLanguageTags` (profile "native") and `kSupportedFocusLanguageTags` (profile "learning") so widening the lookup picker does not regress profile / settings UI.
- **Default source** is resolved by `resolveLookupSourceLanguage({chromeLanguage, activeTrackLanguage})` with this precedence:
  1. `PlaybackChrome.language` — the video's stored language, set by the user at import time on `VideoRow.language` and propagated to `PlaybackChrome.language`. This is the **authoritative** source per the lookup spec (FR-005). Picking the first sibling track instead previously produced wrong-language lookups when the user had tracks in multiple languages.
  2. The **active transcript track**'s `language` — used only when the video's language is `und` / empty (e.g. imported without picking one but with a Korean / Japanese / etc. transcript attached).
  3. Otherwise the resolver returns `null` and `resolveLookupSource` falls back to the **learning language**.
- `resolveLookupSource` then canonicalizes the resolved BCP-47 string: `canonicalLookupTag` (narrow en / zh short-circuit), then matches against the lookup catalog by full BCP-47 tag (e.g. `ko-KR` → `ko-KR`) or by primary subtag (e.g. `ja` → `ja-JP`). `und` / empty / denylisted primaries fall back to the **learning language**.
- **Default target** — `resolveLookupTarget` returns the user's stored native preference when it is in the lookup list; otherwise it falls back via primary-subtag match (e.g. stored `de-AT` → `de-DE`), then to the first non-source non-learning entry. Null / empty / denylisted natives use the legacy `coerceNativeIfEqualsLearning` path so existing en-US / zh-CN users see no behavior change (zh-CN for learn=en-US, en-US for learn=zh-CN).
- **In-sheet override** — Source / target can be changed per lookup via the picker row (`LookupLanguagePickerRow`); choices are **not** persisted (web parity). Option lists are pre-sorted with the user's learning language first (via `sortLookupLanguages`), then alphabetical by primary subtag, then by region.
- **Cache invalidation** — `LookupSheetResultCache.evictForPair(source, target)` is called before each `setState` on source / target change and on swap, so stale results from the prior pair cannot be observed above the new pair's loading skeletons (FR-006, FR-010, SC-004).
- **Worker payloads** — Translation, dictionary, and contextual system prompts use **stripped base** language codes (`workerLanguageBase`) so the backend never receives regioned `und` or full BCP-47 where the worker expects `en` / `ko` / `ja` etc.
- **Worker rejection** — When the worker rejects a chosen source / target pair (e.g. unsupported regional variant), the section renders `LookupErrorRow` with the localized message + **Retry** affordance. No silent fallback to `en-US` / `zh-CN`.

## UX rules

- **Tap-to-seek** is **disabled** on selectable rows (active + echo cues); other rows behave as before.
- **Selection toolbar** is suppressed on transcript selections; the sheet is the primary affordance.
- **Signed out** — Translation, dictionary, and contextual sections **do not** call the Worker while the user is not `AuthSignedIn`. Each section shows a compact **Account required** callout with a **Sign in** button (`AuthRequiredCallout`) that navigates to `/sign-in?from=…`. After **AuthFailure** (e.g. expired session), the same callout is shown instead of a retry-only error row.
- **Translation** section is expanded on first open and fetches immediately when signed in. **Definition (dictionary)** and **contextual translation** start **collapsed** — expand once to fetch when signed in (saves credits vs eager triple fetch).
- **Sheet chrome** — Header, selected term (hero panel with gradient + border), and language row are grouped at the top; scrollable sections use elevated cards (`LookupExpansionCard`) with a nested content well. **Copy** uses a tonal icon button and shows a short **success notice** (`AppNotice` / `lookupCopySuccess`).
- **Language row** — Single segmented control with chevrons on source/target and a centered swap control.
