# Feature: Settings

## Summary

The Settings hub is reached at `/settings` and groups every preference surface in one editorial screen. It's **searchable**, renders as a **single-column** list on narrow/mobile widths and a **two-pane** rail + detail layout at/above `EnjoyThemeTokens.breakpointRail` (900px) on desktop, and default-collapses the low-frequency Developer and About sections. It also hosts two **sub-screens** — `/settings/hotkeys` (keyboard shortcuts) and `/settings/sync` (cloud metadata sync status) — and the **About / update** entry.

Section content lives in one file per section under `lib/features/settings/presentation/widgets/sections/`, shared by both the single-column and two-pane layouts (see [Code map](#code-map)). See `specs/004-settings-redesign/` for the redesign spec/plan/tasks that produced this structure.

## Routes

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/settings` | Hub screen |
| `/settings/hotkeys` | Keyboard shortcuts editor (sub-screen) |
| `/settings/sync` | Cloud metadata sync status (sub-screen) |

## Search

`SettingsSearchField` writes to `settingsSearchQueryProvider` (a `@riverpod` string notifier). `filterSettingsEntries(query, entries)` (pure function, `lib/features/settings/domain/settings_search_entry.dart`) matches case-insensitively against each row's title and keywords in the static `SettingsSearchEntry` registry (one entry per section/row — Account, Cloud sync, Appearance & Language ×3, AI providers, Recording, Keyboard shortcuts ×2, Developer ×3, About ×2 — the "Contact the developer" row matches keywords like "email"/"wechat"/"mixin").

- A match inside a currently-collapsed section (Developer/About) auto-expands that section so the match is visible.
- A query matching nothing shows a "no results" empty state with a clear affordance that restores the prior collapse state.
- In the two-pane layout, non-matching sections are hidden from the rail and the current selection auto-jumps to the first matching section if it no longer matches.

## Layout

`SettingsScreen` uses a `LayoutBuilder` keyed on `EnjoyThemeTokens.breakpointRail`:

- **Below the breakpoint** → `SettingsLayoutSingleColumn`: every section rendered in reading order via `SettingsSectionCard`/`SettingsCollapsibleSection`, applying default-collapse from `settingsSectionCollapseProvider` (`Map<String, bool>`, seeded `true` only for `developer` and `about`).
- **At/above the breakpoint** → `SettingsLayoutTwoPane`: a rail of `SettingsSectionRailItem`s (selected-state highlight matching `AppSidebar`) plus a detail pane rendering the selected section's rows via the *same* `sections/*.dart` widgets. Selection is tracked by `settingsSelectedSectionProvider` (defaults to `account`) and survives repeated resizing across the breakpoint. The Account rail item is the one exception: instead of a `sections/*.dart` widget, it renders `ProfileContent` (shared with the standalone `/profile` route) directly inline — see [Account section](#account-section) below.

Every settings row is a `SettingsRow` (icon, title, subtitle, value badge, optional chevron) — shared by both layouts so a value badge is never clipped in a way that hides the current value, even at narrow widths (a long value wraps below the title instead of disappearing). Capability-gated rows (e.g. native language when the learning language leaves only one native choice) render with `onTap: null` and keep their explanatory subtitle instead of silently omitting the control.

## Sections

- **Account** — see [Account section](#account-section) below; behavior differs between single-column (hero card + link) and two-pane (full profile inline).
- **Cloud sync** (`sections/cloud_sync_section.dart`) — status pill (synced / queued / error) read from the sync queue snapshot; links to `/settings/sync`.
- **Appearance & Language** (`sections/appearance_language_section.dart`) — display, learning, and native language pickers (`language_choice_sheet.dart`). Each pick updates its row's value badge immediately with no need to leave the hub. Native language is capability-gated to the choices that remain after excluding the current learning language.
- **AI providers** (`sections/ai_providers_section.dart`) — per-modality BYOK provider configuration entry point.
- **Recording** (`sections/recording_section.dart`) — microphone picker dialog (auto + every input device returned by `AudioRecorder.listInputDevices()`; see [`echo-mode.md`](echo-mode.md) for the virtual-device skip list). An empty device list still renders an explanatory subtitle rather than a blank row.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (`sections/keyboard_shortcuts_section.dart`) — link to `/settings/hotkeys` (full editor); desktop-only.
- **Developer** (`sections/developer_section.dart`) — API base URL editors for the **Worker** and the **AI gateway**, plus a link to the AI playground (see [`ai.md`](ai.md)); visible only in debug builds; default-collapsed.
- **About / update** (`sections/about_section.dart`, wrapping `about_section_card.dart`) — gradient About card, a link into the update prompt flow (see [`update.md`](update.md)), and a "Contact the developer" row that opens `developer_contact_sheet.dart`, a bottom sheet listing Email/WeChat/Mixin; tapping any row copies the value to the clipboard and shows an `AppNotice.success` confirmation. Default-collapsed.

## Sub-screens

### `/settings/hotkeys`

Full keyboard shortcut editor. Backed by `HotkeysService` (see [`hotkeys.md`](hotkeys.md)); the screen shows current bindings, surfaces conflicts, and offers a confirmation dialog on save. Restyled to `SettingsRow`/`SettingsSectionCard` for visual consistency with the hub (no change to hotkey domain logic).

### `/settings/sync`

Cloud metadata sync status (see [`sync.md`](sync.md)). Shows the queue, last sync time, per-target progress, and a manual sync button. Read-only; the user cannot change sync configuration from this screen (that's in the [ADR-0010](../decisions/0010-cloud-sync-mvp.md) cloud-sync MVP scope). Restyled to `SettingsRow`/`SettingsSectionCard` for visual consistency (no change to sync domain logic).

## Account section

Single-column (mobile) and two-pane (desktop) render Account differently:

- **Single-column** → `sections/account_hero_section.dart`: a compact identity card (avatar, name, email) or a sign-in prompt, with a shimmer skeleton while loading and a retry affordance on load failure. Tapping the card pushes the full `/profile` route (`ProfileScreen`).
- **Two-pane** → the detail pane renders `ProfileContent` (`lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/profile_content.dart`) directly, with `showRefreshIndicator: false`. This is the *same* widget that powers the standalone `/profile` route (see [`auth.md`](auth.md#profile)), so wide-screen users see and edit their full profile — practice stats, subscription/credits nav, name/goal/language preferences, sign out — without ever leaving the Settings hub. Pull-to-refresh doesn't make sense inside the hub's own scroll view, so this mode shows a small manual refresh icon button instead (mirrors the `cloudRefreshTooltip` pattern used for the Cloud tab in the library screen).

Both paths share the same signed-in/loading/error states from `authCtrlProvider`. Settings requires a signed-in Enjoy account ([ADR-0031](../decisions/0031-login-only-access.md)); unsigned users are redirected to sign-in before reaching this screen.

## Sign-out flow

Confirmation dialog explains cloud-side consequences (per-target recordings will remain on the server, scoped to the account). On confirm: `authCtrlProvider.signOut()` clears the secure token store, closes the per-user SQLite, and routes back to `/sign-in`.

## Accessibility

- `SettingsCollapsibleSection` respects OS reduced-motion: expand/collapse still animates via `AnimatedSize`/`AnimatedRotation`, but with a near-instant (1ms, not a literal zero — see below) duration, and the toggle is always a real tap target rather than depending on the animation to complete.
- Every interactive row (`SettingsRow`) and rail item (`SettingsSectionRailItem`) is keyboard-focusable; `SettingsSectionRailItem` shows an explicit focus ring border when focused and not selected.
- A literal `Duration.zero` on `AnimatedSize` throws a Flutter framework assertion ("`RenderAnimatedSize` was mutated in its own `performLayout`") because the animation controller's listener re-dirties layout mid-pass — use a 1ms duration instead when reduced motion is enabled.
